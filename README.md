## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
- Built it by my own, this was easier than last one and i know, this is a very easy one to build but i feel its a litle progress for me by doing by myself, without searching for solutions.
- Nothing new learned i think, it is pretty the same as the previous challenge.

### Continued development
-Still need practicise on positionating elements
